# North-Carolina-State-Salary

Data is taken from data.world and can be found here: https://data.world/mtdukes/nc-state-employees.  It represents North Carolina state salaries from 2017.  Each csv file is a subset taken from nc_salary.csv.

This is a simple R script that performs linear regression and generates five visualizations using ggplot2.  After doing the regressions, I do see that they don't reflect the data very well but I decided to upload it anyway.
